RunPool: Dynamic Pooling Layer for CNN
RunPool pooling is different from traditional pooling that obtains the highest valued activation out of the pooling window or takes an average value of a pooling window. The proposed pooling layers try to find appropriate pooling sequence by calculating several informative parameters in each layer. It is a stochastic pooling approach for CNN  to reduce overfitting.

This project provide 1D dataset for training the model. Luckily, you can apply this pooling scheme in 2D (image) and 3D (Video & Voice) dataset.
